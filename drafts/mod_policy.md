## Discussion of sensitive topics

Users are allowed to discuss sensitive topics, politics included. Disagreements and debate are normal parts of discussion and will be allowed, so long as they are civil, sensible disagreements. All discussion must also follow Discord’s TOS.

 
**Good:**
User 1: I don’t agree with you that people should have a universal income because XYZ
User 2: No you’re wrong, people should have a universal income because XYZ
  
**Bad:**
User 1: I think LGBTQ+ people deserve more rights
User 2: No they don’t, you’re stupid


If a discussion needs to be stopped, a moderator should first try to de-escalate the situation either by telling participants to stop talking about a topic or by other means. Infracting users (mute or warn) should only be done after verbal warnings and after other means of de-escalating the conversation have been exhausted. Infractions should be a last resort.

**Example of other means:**

User: Are you stupid? I said...XYZ
Moderator: Stop using condescending language


Moderators should keep in mind that although infractions are a last resort, there are cases where an infraction will be the first course of action. If a user is making racist comments, homophobic comments, violent comments, etc. then mutes/warns are necessary.
  

## Cursing/Jokes/Making Fun

Cursing is allowed. Cursing at someone is allowed. Joking with someone or making fun of someone in a rude way is also allowed. Moderators should take action if one party shows displeasure or discomfort with the language/conversation. If a user isn’t taking it as a joke or they make a report, then moderators should tell both parties to disengage conversation and to not talk to each other. Infractions should only be given if they do not listen or if Discord’s TOS are broken.
